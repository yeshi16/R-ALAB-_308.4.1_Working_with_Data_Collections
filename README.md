# R-ALAB 308.4.1: Working with Data Collections

### Introduction
This assignment will have you create two different data processing algorithms. The first stage will have you transform raw data into a formatted array of objects according to a specification. The second stage will have you use the output from the first stage to provide a textual report on the data.

### Objectives
- Use arrays to store ordered lists of data.
- Use objects to store keyed lists of data.
- Use conditional logic to process data.
- Use loops to handle repetitive tasks.
- Transform data according to specifi cations.

Part 1: Refactoring Old Code

Part 2: Expanding Functionality

Part 3: Transforming Data
